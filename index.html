                    Sustaining Forests for People and the Planet

                    Human society and the global economy are inextricably linked to forests. <br>
                    More than 1 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods. <br>
                    And forest ecosystems play a critical role in stabilizing the climate;<br>
                    providing food, water, wood products, and vital medicines; and supporting <br>
                    much of the worldâ€™s biodiversity. <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite decreased deforestation rates in some regions, forest ecosystems are<br>
                    still under great threat. According to WRI research, 30 percent of global forest<br>
                    cover has been cleared, while another 20 percent has been degraded. Most of the <br>
                    rest has been fragmented, leaving only about 15 percent intact.
